### Exercise Question:

- The exercise involves designing a website using HTML that showcases 12 files. These files consist of 6 audio and 6 video files.

### HTML Structure:

- The webpage starts with a heading (`<h1>`) introducing Exercise 1 and a description list (`<dl>`) presenting the question.
- The question is encapsulated in a definition term (`<dt>`) and a definition description (`<dd>`).

### Video Example:

- A video element (`<video>`) is provided as an example, featuring a width of 200 pixels, a video source ("vide1.mp4"), a poster image ("1.png"), and controls for user interaction.

### How to Use:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Observe the exercise question and the video example.

### Note:

- This is a starting point for the exercise, and you can expand the HTML to include all 12 files (audio and video) as needed.
- Customize the content, styles, and additional features based on the exercise requirements and your preferences.
