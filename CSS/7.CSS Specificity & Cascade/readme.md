**CSS Specificity:**
CSS specificity is a measure of how specific a selector is in targeting HTML elements. It determines which style declarations are applied to an element when conflicting styles exist. Specificity is typically represented as a four-part value, where each part corresponds to a different level of specificity: inline styles, IDs, classes and attributes, and elements.

Here's the breakdown of specificity:

1. **Inline Styles:** Inline styles have the highest specificity. They are applied directly to an element using the `style` attribute.

2. **IDs:** ID selectors have a higher specificity than classes and attributes. They are represented as `#id`.

3. **Classes and Attributes:** Selectors that target classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes have a medium specificity. Examples include `.class`, `[attribute]`, and `:hover`.

4. **Elements:** Selecting elements (e.g., `div`, `p`, `h1`) has the lowest specificity. It applies styles to all matching elements.

In a specificity comparison, a higher-specificity selector will override a lower-specificity one. For example, an ID selector will override a class selector.

**Cascade Algorithm:**
The cascade algorithm determines the priority and order in which styles are applied when multiple styles conflict. The cascade is based on the following principles:

1. **Importance:** Styles marked as `!important` have the highest priority.

2. **Specificity:** As discussed above, more specific selectors take precedence over less specific ones.

3. **Source Order:** If two rules have the same specificity, the one declared later in the stylesheet or HTML document takes precedence.

4. **Origin:** Styles from different origins (author, user, browser) have different priorities. User styles (e.g., user stylesheets or browser preferences) can override author styles.

**Conditions for CSS Property Application:**

When there's a conflict between CSS property values, the following conditions determine which value is applied:

1. **Importance (`!important`):** If a style is marked as `!important`, it takes the highest priority.

2. **Specificity:** More specific selectors take precedence over less specific ones.

3. **Source Order:** If two rules have the same specificity, the one declared later in the stylesheet or HTML document takes precedence.

4. **Inheritance:** If no styles are applied to an element, it inherits styles from its parent. However, inherited styles can be overridden by more specific or later-declared styles.

Understanding these principles helps in creating maintainable and predictable styles in CSS.
