# README: CSS Selectors and Pseudo-Selectors

## Overview

This HTML document showcases the usage of various CSS selectors and pseudo-selectors to style different elements on a webpage. Each selector targets specific HTML elements or conditions, providing a comprehensive example of how selectors can be utilized in styling.

## CSS Selectors Used

### 1. **Element Selector (`div`):**
   - Targets all `<div>` elements.

### 2. **Class Selector (` .yellow`):**
   - Targets elements with the class "yellow" and applies a yellow background.

### 3. **ID Selector (` #green`):**
   - Targets the element with the ID "green" and applies a green background.

### 4. **Child Selector (`div > p`):**
   - Targets `<p>` elements that are direct children of `<div>` elements and sets the text color to red.

### 5. **Descendant Selector (`div span`):**
   - Targets `<span>` elements that are descendants of `<div>` elements and sets the text color.

### 6. **Universal Selector (`*`):**
   - Applies styles to all elements on the page, setting margin and padding to zero.

### 7. **Pseudo-Selectors:**
   - **`a:link`:** Styles unvisited links, removing text decoration.
   - **`a:visited`:** Styles visited links with a specific color.
   - **`a:hover`:** Styles links on hover with a different color.
   - **`li:first-child`:** Styles the first child `<li>` element with a larger font size.
